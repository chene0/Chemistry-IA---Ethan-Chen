  abstract = {Bentonite () is an absorbent swelling clay consisting mostly of montmorillonite (a type of smectite) which can either be Na-montmorillonite or Ca-montmorillonite.  Na-montmorillonite has a considerably greater swelling capacity than Ca-montmorillonite. Bentonite usually forms from the weathering of volcanic ash in seawater, or by hydrothermal circulation through the porosity of volcanic ash beds, which converts (devitrification) the volcanic glass (obsidian, rhyolite, dacite) present in the ash into clay minerals. In the mineral alteration process, a large fraction (up to 40{\textendash}50 wt.\%) of amorphous silica is dissolved and leached away, leaving the bentonite deposit in place. Bentonite beds are white or pale blue or green (traces of reduced Fe2+) in fresh exposures, turning to a cream color and then yellow, red, or brown (traces of oxidized Fe3+) as the exposure is weathered further.As a swelling clay, bentonite has the ability to absorb large quantities of water, which increases its volume by up to a factor of eight. This makes bentonite beds unsuitable for building and road construction. However, the swelling property is used to advantage in drilling mud and groundwater sealants. The montmorillonite / smectite making up bentonite is an aluminium phyllosilicate mineral, which takes the form of microscopic platy grains. These give the clay a very large total surface area, making bentonite a valuable adsorbent. The plates also adhere to each other when wet. This gives the clay a cohesiveness that makes it useful as a binder and as an additive to improve the plasticity of kaolinite clay used for pottery.One of the first findings of bentonite was in the Cretaceous Benton Shale near Rock River, Wyoming. The Fort Benton Group, along with others in stratigraphic succession, was named after Fort Benton, Montana, in the mid-19th century by Fielding Bradford Meek and F. V. Hayden of the U.S. Geological Survey. Bentonite has since been found in many other locations, including China and Greece (bentonite deposit of the Milos volcanic island in the Aegean Sea). The total worldwide production of bentonite in 2018 was 20,400,000 metric tons.},

  abstract = {, The stepwise hydration of clay minerals has been observed repeatedly in studies, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Previous numerical studies confirmed the presence of one-water layer (1W) and two-water layer (2W) hydration states. However, the undisturbed transition between these hydration states has never been captured. Using molecular dynamics simulation, this study (i) simulated for the first time the free 1W{\textendash}2W transition during clay hydration and (ii) identified the underlying mechanism to be the detachment of cations from the clay surface and the formation of a shell of water molecules around the cation. The swelling dynamics of clay was found to be affected by the clay charge, clay mineralogy, and counterions through complex cation{\textendash}clay interactions, cation hydration capacity, and cation migration rate.},

These results are discussed in light of the charge variability and of anion retention by the kaolinitic soil.},

  abstract = {Montmorillonite is a very soft phyllosilicate group of minerals that form when they precipitate from water solution as microscopic crystals, known as clay. It is named after Montmorillon in France. Montmorillonite, a member of the smectite group, is a 2:1 clay, meaning that it has two tetrahedral sheets of silica sandwiching a central octahedral sheet of alumina. The particles are plate-shaped with an average diameter around 1 {$\mu$}m and a thickness of 0.96 nm; magnification of about 25,000 times, using an electron microscope, is required to resolve individual clay particles. Members of this group include saponite, nontronite, beidellite, and hectorite. Montmorillonite is a subclass of smectite, a 2:1 phyllosilicate mineral characterized as having greater than 50\% octahedral charge; its cation exchange capacity is due to isomorphous substitution of Mg for Al in the central alumina plane. The substitution of lower valence cations in such instances leaves the nearby oxygen atoms with a net negative charge that can attract cations. In contrast, beidellite is smectite with greater than 50\% tetrahedral charge originating from isomorphous substitution of Al for Si in the silica sheet. The individual crystals of montmorillonite clay are not tightly bound hence water can intervene, causing the clay to swell, hence montmorillonite is a characteristic component of swelling soil. The water content of montmorillonite is variable and it increases greatly in volume when it absorbs water. Chemically, it is hydrated sodium calcium aluminium magnesium silicate hydroxide (Na,Ca)0.33(Al,Mg)2(Si4O10)(OH)2{$\cdot$}nH2O. Potassium, iron, and other cations are common substitutes, and the exact ratio of cations varies with source.  It often occurs intermixed with chlorite, muscovite, illite, cookeite, and kaolinite.},

  abstract = {The ever-increasing number of failures of industrial structures due to the heaving of acid-contaminated foundation soils has necessitated a better understanding of soil behavior under changing and extreme environmental conditions. Thus, this paper attempts to micro-mechanistically explain the swelling characteristics of soils contaminated with inorganic acids. Three soils with widely varying physical and chemical properties, namely, natural black cotton soil and commercially available bentonite and kaolin clay, were selected for the investigation. Special Teflon-made oedometer cells, which are entirely non-reactive to acid, were used to assess the swelling behavior. The soils were inundated with two concentrations of sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid and allowed to swell. The results indicate that, in montmorillonitic soils, the type of cation in the exchangeable complex plays a dominant role in governing the swelling behavior of clays during acid contamination. The mineralogical changes due to cation exchange reactions, along with the partial mineral dissolution, resulted in the acid-induced swelling in montmorillonitic soils. In the kaolin clay, the face-to-edge association of the particles due to the adsorption of H+ by broken edges led to an increase in swelling along with mineralogical changes.},
